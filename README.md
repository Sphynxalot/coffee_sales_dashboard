# ☕ Coffee Sales Dashboard

## 📌 Overview
This project is a full-scale data analysis dashboard designed to visualize and analyze coffee sales data. The system processes transactional data using:

✔ Microsoft Excel (Data processing, formulas, and visualization)  
✔ XLOOKUP, INDEX, and IF formulas (Data validation and transformation)  
✔ Dynamic filtering for interactive data exploration  

With this dashboard, users can:  
✔ Track total sales over time across different coffee bean types.  
✔ Analyze sales performance by country.  
✔ Identify the top five highest-spending customers.  
✔ Filter data dynamically based on various criteria (Roast Type, Size, Loyalty Card, Order Date).  

This data-driven approach helps businesses optimize sales strategies by identifying key trends and customer preferences.
